# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

# Introduction
Credit card fraud detection is crucial for financial security. This project uses machine learning algorithms to classify transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent based on transaction data. It leverages supervised learning techniques to build an effective model for early fraud detection.

#Features
Data preprocessing and handling of imbalanced data

Implementation of various classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests)

Model evaluation using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score

Option to tune hyperparameters for better accuracy

# Dataset
The dataset used is typically a collection of credit card transactions, labeled as either fraudulent or legitimate. You can use the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset or any other similar dataset.

# Technologies

**Python** - Core programming language for data processing and model training
**Pandas** - For data manipulation and analysis
**Scikit-Learn** - For implementing machine learning algorithms
**Matplotlib/Seaborn** - For data visualization and exploratory analysis
**Imbalanced-Learn** - For handling imbalanced datasets (e.g., SMOTE)
